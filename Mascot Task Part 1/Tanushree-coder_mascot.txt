Chosen character : 
github's logo (octocat) mascot

Personality of this character :
standing confident with keen observation on contributors.

Poses, Emotions, Outfits, and Scenes :
standing position with a magnifying glass in it's one hand (in search of open source enthusiasts with outshining ideas), wearing a coat (just like a detective wears coat in cartoon characters) and a banner in it's other hand displaying symbol "</>" (signifying 'code' that will help developers contribute to real-life projects)

Since *OpenCode* is a open source program and the platform chosen is 'Github', I thought github's logo will be best suited for choosing mascot.
