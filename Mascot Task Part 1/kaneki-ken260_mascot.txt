OpenCode - Mascot

Type of Mascot:  Animal
Animal: Alligator
It is because an alligator is a calm creature that waits for the right moment to attack
or in the case of developers to grab the opportunity😂😂.

Name of the mascot: Ally

Personality:
Calm, Confident, Fast, Accurate, Focused

In this opencode event, every developer out there has to be calm while claiming and resolving the issues just like the alligator that stays calm while approaching to its prey.

Moreover, we have to be adaptive to the challenges we face during this event (which are: fast claiming issues, sleepless nights, new skillsets) just like an alligator adapts to the land and water circumstances.

In this opencode event we have to stay focused throughout the time we resolve an issue.
These are all the inspiration we could get from “Ally”- the mascot of Opencode.

Expressions and costumes:

“Ally” would be a calm and fun loving mascot.
He would be having a smile on its face, to spread positivity.

“Ally” would be wearing an opencode merch.

Poses and some scenes:

We can show “Ally” working on a laptop where he is completely focussed on the task.
We can also show “Ally” standing in a confident posture with a coffee mug, as this would clearly show how developers have coffee always along side them 😂.
