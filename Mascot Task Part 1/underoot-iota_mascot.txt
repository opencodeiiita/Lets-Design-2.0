Name of Mascot: Bee
Type of Mascot: Animal (Bee)


Why a Bee?
I chose a bee as mascot cause bees work collectively. In a beehive, thousands of bees work together cooperatively
to survive and maintain the beehive. They all play a role in the construction and maintenance of the beehive, 
no matter how tiny or large that role is.
Similarly, in OpenCode, a large number of people get together to collaborate on diverse projects in order to 
create/improve wonderful projects. They all participate, cooperate, and collaborate to bring out 
the best in each other.
